# vr-sandbox
Git repository for Unity VR sandbox development.

If you're here visiting, welcome! This is the repository for an exploratory and experimental project I worked on during the COVID-19 pandemic.

I never had intentions to release this as a full game, but started working on a rogue-like VR project that involved grid-based dynamic level generation, entirely hand-built 3D models (which was an excellent foray into Blender!), custom functions for handling haptic feedback in controllers and estimating physics calculations across objects being wielded "with two hands", as well as a suite of fun features that allowed me to personally experience a fraction of the fantastic possibilies of virtual space.

As this project was completely independent and not intended for release, I was only able to test this build on a first generation Valve Index (with the associated Index controllers.) Should anyone try to compile and build this on their own for testing purposes, I'd be unable to confirm whether or not it will render correctly on other hardware. Additionally, one of the emerging issues in this project is that it makes heavy use of the SteamVR libraries and their associated built-ins - the modern method (as of 2022) is to use OpenXR for more universal input and export capabilities for non-PC hardware.
